- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey trust and reliability, reflecting the professional nature of the car maintenance service.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F3F5), a very low saturation version of the blue that provides a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Teal (#309292), used sparingly for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for body text.
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for a computerized, techy, scientific feel for headers.
- Use simple, consistent icons for navigation and service categories to enhance usability.
- Implement a clean, modern layout with clear sections for easy navigation.
